# Task Manager

This is a simple Task Manager application built using **React** to showcase several core skills. The project demonstrates the following skills:

- **React Hooks** (useState, useEffect)
- **React Router** for page navigation
- **React Context API** (or Redux) for state management
- **API calls** to fetch and manipulate task data
- **Form handling** for task creation
- **Component composition** and props usage

## Key Features

### Home Page
- A dashboard displaying a list of tasks.
- Ability to filter tasks by their status (e.g., "All", "Completed", "Pending").

### Add Task Page
- A form that allows users to add a new task (title, description, due date).
- Includes form validation (e.g., required fields).

### Task Details Page
- Displays detailed information about a selected task.
- Options to mark the task as complete or delete it.

### State Management
- Uses **React Context API** (or Redux) to manage tasks globally.

### API Integration
- Mock API calls using **fetch** (or axios) to simulate loading tasks from an external source.

### Styling
- A simple and responsive layout, styled using CSS or a CSS framework like **Bootstrap** or **Tailwind**.
